# Feedback is fuel

This course is about providing effective feedback using the SBI model and different types of feedbacks.

## Steps to Provide Feedback

1. **Ask Permission**: Before giving feedback, it's respectful to ask the person if they're open to it.

3. **Identify the SBI**: Describe the specific behavior and its impact.
4. **Ask for Reactions**: After sharing your feedback, ask the person for their perspective.
5. **Agree on Changes**: Discuss and agree on potential improvements.

## SBI Model

## Affirming Feedbacks

### Recognition

### Encouragement
Encouragement is about motivating someone to continue doing good work. 

### Maintenance
Maintenance is about suggesting someone to keep their current level of performance. 

### Elevation
Elevation is about suggesting someone to aim for higher levels of performance. 

### Continuation

## Constructive Feedbacks

Constructive feedbacks are suggestions for improvement.

### Adjustment

### Reduction
Reduction is about suggesting someone to do less of a certain behavior. 

### Inclusion

## When to Provide Feedback

Feedback should be provided in a timely and considerate manner. Here are some guidelines:

### Ideally 24-48 hours
Feedback should ideally be given within **24-48 hours** of the observed behavior. This ensures that the details are fresh in everyone's mind.

### On a regular basis
Feedback should be provided **on a regular basis**. Regular feedback can help individuals continuously improve and feel valued.

### Prepare enough time to discuss
Ensure you have **enough time to discuss** the feedback. Rushed feedback sessions might not be as effective.

### Consider personal circumstances and impact on performance
Always **consider personal circumstances** and how they might be impacting an individual's performance. Empathy is key in providing effective feedback.

## How to Provide Feedback

Providing feedback effectively is a skill that can be learned and improved. Here are some guidelines:

### Come prepared
Before giving feedback, **come prepared**. Understand the situation, the behavior you observed, and its impact. 

### Use SBI
Use the **SBI (Situation, Behavior, Impact) model**. This model helps structure your feedback in a clear and concise way.

### Own the feedback
**Own the feedback**. Use "I" statements to express your observations and feelings. This helps to avoid blaming and to keep the conversation constructive.

### Check for understanding and make plans together
After giving feedback, **check for understanding** and **make plans together**. This ensures that the person receiving feedback understands it and that you both agree on next steps.
