# Fierce Conversations

Fierce conversations emphasize the importance of effective communication in achieving success. Authentic, meaningful and engaging dialogues that address our most challenging problems.

## Core Ideas

The concept is built on three core ideas:

1. **Successes and failures don't happen overnight**: They are shaped one conversation at a time, until they cross a tipping point to suddenly bloom or collapse.
2. **Conversation = Relationship**: Your conversations are your relationships. When you avoid something in a conversation, you limit the possibilities in that relationship.
3. **Your biggest challenges are about you**: We see others as we are. We don't hear what others say; we only hear our stories and interpretation of what they say.

## Seven Principles of Fierce Conversations

We can then outline seven principles of fierce conversations:

1. **Have the Courage to Investigate Reality**: Reality is relative, not absolute. There are always multiple truths, as seen from different perspectives. The only way to get a full picture is to incorporate everyone’s views.
2. **Come Out from Behind Yourself into the Conversation and Make It Real**: Be authentic and present in your conversations.
3. **Be Here, Prepared to Be Nowhere Else**: Be fully engaged in the conversation.
4. **Tackle Your Toughest Challenge Today**: Don't avoid difficult topics or issues.
5. **Obey Your Instincts**: Trust your gut feelings and intuition.
6. **Take Responsibility for Your Emotional Wake**: Be aware of the impact of your words and actions on others.
7. **Let Silence Do the Heavy Lifting**: Allow for pauses and silence in the conversation to give space for thought and reflection.

## Practical Exercises and Tools

Here are a few examples:

### Discussion Questions

These questions can help stimulate conversation and reflection:

1. **What conversation have you been unable to have?**
2. **If you were guaranteed an honest response to any three questions, whom would you question and what would you ask?**
3. **What are the conversations you need to have, and with whom?**
4. **For you, what makes a conversation real?**
5. **Think about the truth. What is the truth, and does anybody own it?**

### Activities

These activities can be done in small groups, triads or pairs:

1. **From Taking Stock**: Consider the following questions:
    - What are your goals when you converse with people?
    - What kinds of things do you usually discuss?
    - Are there other topics that would be more interesting?

These quotes can be used to stimulate conversation:
